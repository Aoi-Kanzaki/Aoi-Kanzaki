              many features. Remind yourself something, or even play some music
              in a voice channel! Got a pesky mod that keeps changing channels
              and you can't track down who did it? Setup Aoi's modlog system in

            <p>
              I created Aoi a long time ago, the project first started with the
              name Brooklyn Bot about 7 years ago... I then moved on a and
              changed the name to F.res.h and worked on it with a very old
              friend of mine. Then just recently changed the name to Aoi. I've
              been working on this project for who knows how long. It's always
              just been a little hobby project of mine that I was doing in my
              freetime and to help out fellow community owners and friends.
