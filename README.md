## About The Project

Aoi Kanzaki is a Multi-Function discord bot that I have been working on for a while. I have created other projects such as Brooklyn Bot, Kira-Miki and more.
Aoi contains a ton of features, from music to leveling and more. (More will be added.)

### Built With

Here you will find some things you will need.

- [Lavalink.py](https://github.com/Devoxin/Lavalink.py)
- [Lavlink.jar](https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink)
- [Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/)
- [Python3.9+](https://www.python.org/)
- [MongoDb](https://docs.mongodb.com/)
- [Java Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/)

## Getting Started

Read to install and setup? No problem! That's what this part of the page is for.

### Installation

1. Install python if you don't have it already. (Make sure to install version 3.9 or later)

2. Install java also if you don't have it

3. You will need a mongodb connection URI, so go ahead and get that ready and set up.

4. You're going to need a Spotify api key for the music module. You can get one at the link below.
   https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/

5. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/Aoi-Kanzaki/Aoi-Kanzaki.git`

6. Move into the bots directory

7. Install requirements `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

8. Rename `config.json.example` to `config.json` and fill in the config settings.

9. Create a lavalink folder and download the lavalink server. https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink/releases/download/3.6.2/Lavalink.jar
   You will also need a `application.yml` for your lavalink server. You can get one here. https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink/blob/master/LavalinkServer/application.yml.example

10. Start a screen session, press enter, and type the following command to startup the Lavalink server for music.

    ```sh
    screen
    (press enter)
    sudo java -jar Lavalink.jar
    ```

    Disconnect from the screen session by pressing ctrl+A+D

11. Now you should be able to run the bot! Just type the following command!
    `cd .. && python3 bot.py`

## Usage

<p>
  Now how do I use the bot? Well it's simple.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Every command is a slash command so all you will need to do is type <b>/</b> and it will autocomeplete for you.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To get all of the bots commands use the following <b>/help</b>.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If you are wanting help on a specific module use the following <b>/help ModuleName</b>.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also if you're wanting help on a specific command use the following <b>/help CommandName</b>.
