## About The Project

Aoi Kanzaki is a Multi-Function discord bot that I have been working on for a while. I have created other projects such as Brooklyn Bot, Kira-Miki and more.
Aoi contains a ton of features, from music to leveling and more. (More will be added.)

4. You're going to need a Spotify api key for the music module.

```

5. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Aoi-Kanzaki/Aoi-Kanzaki.git
```

6. Move into the bots directory

```sh
cd Aoi-Kanzaki
```

7. Install requirements

```sh
sudo python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

8. Rename `config.json.example` to `config.json` and set prefix as the prefix you want, and token as your bots token.

9. Create a lavalink folder and download the lavalink server. https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink/releases/download/3.6.2/Lavalink.jar

10. You will also need a `application.yml` for your lavalink server. You can get one here. https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink/blob/master/LavalinkServer/application.yml.example

11. Start a screen session, press enter, and type the following command to startup the Lavalink server for music.

```sh
screen
(press enter)
sudo java -jar Lavalink.jar
```

11. Disconnect from the screen session by pressing ctrl+A+D
12. Now you should be able to run the bot! Just type the following command!

```sh
cd .. && python3 bot.py
```

## Usage

<p>
  Now how do I use the bot? Well it's simple.
  <br/>
  Every command is a slash command so all you will need to do is type `/` and it will autocomeplete for you.
  <br/>
  To get all of the bots commands use the following <b>/help</b>.
  <br/>
  If you are wanting help on a specific module use the following <b>/help ModuleName</b>.
  <br/>
  Also if you're wanting help on a specific command use the following <b>/help CommandName</b>.
